 * An excellent analogy to explain insertion sort is the way you would sort a deck of cards. Imagine that you’re holding a group of cards in your hands, and you want to arrange them in order. You’d start by comparing a single card step by step with the rest of the cards until you find its correct position. At that point, you’d insert the card in the correct location and start over with a new card, repeating until all the cards in your hand were sorted.

function insertionSort(arr) {
  // your code here
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let j = i - 1,
      num = arr[i];
    //   # Run through the list of items (the left
    //     # portion of the array) and find the correct position
    //     # of the element referenced by `key_item`. Do this only
    //     # if `key_item` is smaller than its adjacent values.
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] >= num) {
      // # Shift the value one position to the left
      //     # and reposition j to point to the next element
      //     # (from right to left)
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = num;
