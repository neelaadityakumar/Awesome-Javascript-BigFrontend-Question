<h1>17. Create a simple store for DOM element
</h1>

<br/>
We have Map in es6, so we could use any data as key, such as DOM element.

```js
const map = new Map();
map.set(domNode, somedata);
```

What if we need to support old JavaScript env like es5, how would you create your own Node Store as above?

You are asked to implement a Node Store, which supports DOM element as key.

```js
class NodeStore {
  set(node, value) {}

  get(node) {}

  has(node) {}
}
```

1. Map is disabled when judging your code, it is against the goal of practicing.
2. You can create a simple general Map polyfill. Or since you are asked to support specially for DOM element, what is special about DOM element?
3. What is the Time / Space cost of your solution?

```javascript
class NodeStore {
  cache = {};
  set(node, value) {
    node.__ACCESS_KEY__ = Symbol();
    this.cache[node.__ACCESS_KEY__] = value;
  }

  get(node) {
    return this.cache[node.__ACCESS_KEY__];
  }

  has(node) {
    return !!this.cache[node.__ACCESS_KEY__];
  }
}
```

```

```
